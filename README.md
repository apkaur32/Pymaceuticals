# Pymaceuticals
Challenge#5 HW


Background\
I've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications.

As a senior data analyst, I've received complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with 10 drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

This exercise was quite the challenge and was completed with the help of tutor and online resources. One of my goals from this program is to be able to work in clinical trials. This exercise helped me to gain exposure to how clinical data is analyzed using various programming tools and what kind of observations/conclusions we can draw after removing any outliers.
